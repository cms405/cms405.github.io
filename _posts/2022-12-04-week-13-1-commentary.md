One thing that stood out to me was Tufte’s dislike of strong grid systems. For instance, he demonstrates through the New Jersey Transit timetable redesign that removing harsh lines with subtle shading can help calm the display and remove visual barricades. He even goes as far as to state that grids “should be used only when they are absolutely necessary.” However, I’m not sure if I agree with his statement. Most figures and tables in research papers still use defined grid systems even though they are visually less appealing because they clearly define rows/columns and minimize mistakes when reading the table. It made me wonder how designers should balance visual appeal and practicality.

I also found the use of color to create a separate layer interesting. I liked how Tufte brought back principles from earlier chapters, especially when discussing the Berlin map and the way they used strong colors sparingly to create an effective display. I particularly enjoyed the Rome river map example, where a very subtle change in hue of the river was still able to reduce the feeling of clutter in the map.
