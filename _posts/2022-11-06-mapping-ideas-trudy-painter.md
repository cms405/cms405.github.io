I want to make a data visualization of the songs you listen to and where after you go for a run. Often I remember parts of my run by where I was listening to a specific song.

What kind of experience or imagination are you trying to map?

- Geolocation memory in relation to personal data

What are the dimensions of your experience/imagination that you are trying to visualize?

- Memory relationship to physical place and songs

What is the data source for your mapping idea?

- Strava API, Spotify API, Google Maps API

What are possible inspirations for your mapping idea?
