**Envisioning Information, Chapter 3 - Edward Tufte**

In the chapter, Layering and Separation, I found that the most effective methods of identifying interacting information was the use of color as well as the use of negative space. The example of the IBM Series III Adjustment Parts Manual demonstrated how the use of color creates a differentiation between the parts themselves and the annotations — even though there is so much information on the manual, it is still possible to find which part corresponds to each number. Paul Klee’s sketch had a lot of parallels with the manual, because there is a clear separation between the black line and the red commentary (he also played around with thickness too). The Tokyo map shows different elements in different colors on a more muted background, with only a few colors being brighter (red and yellow), which connects back to the “first rule of color composition”. The other aspect I found interesting and effective was the use of negative space. In the same example of the Tokyo map, the white lines, or negative space, between the buildings highlight the roads and paths themselves. Also, in Gaetano Kanizsa’s drawings, the intentional spaces create the appearance of shares in the negative space.
