**Potential Ideas **

- Bathrooms on campus: how they've changed over time (when were men's restrooms converted to women's restroooms? all-gender restrooms?); possible inspiration: [Course 4 thesis on All-Gender Restrooms at MIT](    - https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/144751/Seaman-mapache-SB-Arch-2022-thesis.pdf.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y )
- MIT students and food: where do students eat? how do students feel about the places they eat? where do they eat alone? where do they eat with others? where does our food come from?
- Mapping restaurants that have closed in NYC (specific to Chinatown/LES?); why they've closed, public response; possible inspiration: [map of NYC restaurants that closed due to Covid](https://josephborrello.com/projects-data-blog/2021/3/21/mapping-nycs-restaurants-closed-due-to-covid)
- Mapping movement: Strava data; aggregation of peopleâ€™s running/exercising routes? GPS art?; possible inspiration: [GPS art](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/technology/gps-art-strava-running.html?searchResultPosition=2 )
- Mapping trash: where does our trash go? 
- Maps in politics: possible inspiration: [gerrymandering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/ )
