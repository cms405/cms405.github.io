I thought this chapter was too general. It could have benefited from dividing up the *types* of information you are displaying. 

For example, Tufte starts out by claiming, “to clarify add detail.” He is referencing Constantine Anderson’s map of NYC. This map builds upon an existing, clean grid system. Anderson is able to add detail to the portrayal of buildings, which have already been neatly compartmentalized to their geographic constraints. 

Then Tufte shows examples of more organic, unorganized data (the temperature/conductivity graphs and Tokyo population density). Of course theses are harder graphs to read. The data is less regular, and its harder to fit a consistent grid system approach to them.

If I were Tufte, I would have adjusted the final statement to switch simpleness for regularity → “the _regularity_ of data and design equals clarity.” This is less of a contradiction as you could add detail in a regular grid system to clarify instead of clutter.

Also as an aside, the Tokyo train schedule system reminds me of Maison Margiela’s garment tag system.
