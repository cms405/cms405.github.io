Map of MIT, colored by the color of dreams in the location off where a dream was taking place. For the final product, I was thinking of having the outline of MIT be static, but the colors to be moving around, pulsating, to showcase the weird, morphing nature and experience of dreams and also to showcase the fact that in dreams, physicality of a location often changes.

A lot of the responses we received were super funny/interesting [as you can see here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1euw0asNfs4oNJdHXX-SPD-00xBtv3Hpb0LUmbTirS7o/edit?usp=sharing_eil_se_dm&ts=63727a84). So we were also thinking of being able to double click onto colored areas (where a dream is taking place) to read about the actual dream that happened in that space. In our survey, we also asked for sound, so when you are hovering over the location, but not clicked into it, there could be the sound associated with it playing in the background.

At each location of the map, we were thinking of incooporating a more detailed view when clicked. This would include elements from the dreams described at each location.
