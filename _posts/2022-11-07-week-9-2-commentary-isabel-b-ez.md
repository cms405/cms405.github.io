Tuffe discusses the initial movements towards three-dimensional data representation. He first references paper-model designed, which first achieved three-dimensionality, specifically in Euclid’s Elements (1570). Then, he makes references to the solar systems developed in order to demonstrate accurate planetary positioning. 

An interesting example he gave were stereo illustrations, were two images were given to viewers (one for each eye), in order for them to mentally fuse them together. In accordance with Tuffe, I had trouble actually managing to merge the images in my head and create the desired three-dimensional product. 

He examines Galileo’s studies of Sunspots in the 1600s. Although this process consisted of multiple studies, I fail to see its three-dimensionality. As Tuffe states, the sunspot locations were unclear to astronomers, given the lost of data of the spehre-to-circle translation. Given this, its two-dimensionality makes Galileo’s Sunspots an incomplete data representation. Nevertheless, it did achieve merits significant to its time. Previous to it, the Sun was seen as “flawless”, as, according to Aristotle, it was a “celestial being”. Galileo’s diagram disproved that.
