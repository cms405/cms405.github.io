For me, the first graphical visualizations depicted by Tufte were a little hard to follow. The overlaid map of the New York bus system was unclear. The aerial view was very dark, and made the routes hard to follow. Morever, it was complicated to draw the connection to the graphical representatiom. I do, however, find value in the density created by closer lines for buses that were scheduled close to each other. This charged component is easily connected with the idea of "being busy", which makes sense for a busy schedule of buses. 

I did enjoy the representations of dance. The first, very symbolic ones, were hard to follow, and made me question their universaility. I wondered if the symbols used were something familiar to proffessional dancers, or just a design choice at their moment of creating. The more figurative representations were easier to follow and more comprehensible. This reminded me of the McCloud reading, in which he states that humans map their face, or in this case body, everywhere. Perhaps that is why I perceived these diagrams to be more understandable. Moreover, the last diagram with the adorned text reminded me of a static version of dynamic text, as the movement of the text makes reference to the flow of the dance being represented.
