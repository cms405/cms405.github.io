I think I'm really interested in the connection between fantasy elements and real world. I find fantasy books that are connected or inspired by elements in the real world interesting and I always enjoyed looking at the maps drawn in the beginning. Aother idea I had was mapping video game maps to the locations they are connected with in the real world. For exmaple, some pokemon maps have a fairly direct connection to the certain countires and so it could be cool to morph the video game map to the proprotions of the real world (or vice versa). I think it would be best to pick a franchise that is well documented over time in order to create a collection of relevant data that can be used for mapping.
