title: 'Design Assignment 4: Ideas (Isabel Báez)'
author: Isabel Baez

What kind of experience or imagination are you trying to map?
- My main idea is to map the experience of one’s dreams (while sleeping). I wanted to be able to convey the stages people go through as they dream, and the imagery that is created. 
 
What are the dimensions of your experience/imagination that you are trying to visualize?
- I want to be able to grasp the ins and outs of dreaming. How situations and people merge together into senseless scenes. I also wanted to explore the dimension of nightmares, and what exactly converts a dream into a nightmare. 
 
What is the data source for your mapping idea?
- Retelling of people’s dreams. 
- Online texts of people discussing their own dreams and how they made them feel
 
What are possible inspirations for your mapping idea?
- I wanted be inspired by psychedelic designs, and abstract representations of everyday things
- Music based on the idea of Dreaming (ex. Dreamland by Glass Animals)
