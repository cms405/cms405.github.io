For certain data, detail and the whole set are both equally as important (either within the same context or for differing but both relevant contexts) and in those cases, data visualization and presentation should include details and the whole picture; by the whole picture, I mean a way in which the viewer can get an understanding of the data (in number sets, this can be the number of data points, the average, the median, the range, etc) without getting bogged down by the details. An example of this that Tufte examines is the design of Lin’s Vietnam War Memorial in Washington DC. As the viewer, you can access the “details” (the individual names of American casualties of the war, the chronological order in which they died) as well as the “greater picture” of the relative amount of casualties of the war during its span. However, I would argue that the memorial still does not do that great of a job of conveying detail - if you were to want to find a specific name engraved within the granite, you must use a separate index entity in order to find the name.

A more effective design is the stem and leaf plot, especially the one of the 218 volcanoes, since you can see the individual volcano heights, and you can also see the distribution of the heights. However, in terms of a data usage perspective, the plot is more difficult to deal with than a list of the data points arranged from low to high or vice versa. However, this might be just because the former is the form in which we are most used to receiving data in.
