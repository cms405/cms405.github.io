title: Ch 4 Small Multiples - Trudy Painter
author: Trudy Painter
---
I really liked this chapter. It reminded me rich prospect browsing interfaces, those that "combine a meaningful representation of every item in a collection with a number of emergent tools for manipulating the display." By using small multiples, I feel the scale of a collection of information. And each of the multiples provides context for the slight variation (ie the train light signals).

Many of the diagrams feel imaginative. Like exercises in world building (the different bugs and pictograph characters). I thought this chapter had the most personality of the readings.
